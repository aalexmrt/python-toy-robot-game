# Toy robot game

The Toy Robot Game is a Python application that simulates a toy robot moving on a table board. It has been tested and optimized for Python 3. If you are using Python 2, please be aware that there might be compatibility issues.

## How to run

There are two modes in which you can run the Toy Robot App:

### Interactive mode

In the interactive mode, the app will prompt you to enter instructions manually, and it will visualize the table board and the robot's movements after each instruction.

To run the app in interactive mode, execute the following command in your terminal:
  
`python3 toy_robot_app.py`

### Testing mode

The testing mode allows you to process '.txt' files containing pre-defined sets of instructions. These files can be found in the 'tests/' directory, and they cover all the scenarios listed in the requirements.

To run the app in testing mode, use the following command:

`python3 toy_robot_app.py --testing-path tests/`

## Requirements

Before running the Toy Robot App, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
